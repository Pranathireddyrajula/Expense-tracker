
Here’s a README.md file for your Streamlit application. This document will guide users on setting up, running, and using the Daily Expense Prediction app.

Daily Expense Prediction App
This Streamlit application predicts daily expenses using machine learning models and provides interactive visualizations for data analysis. Users can upload their own dataset, select features, choose different models, and adjust hyperparameters to see real-time predictions and visualizations.

Features
Upload Your Dataset: Users can upload a CSV file containing daily expenses.
Data Preprocessing: Automatic feature extraction and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
Multiple Model Options: Supports Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Allows interactive adjustment of hyperparameters for each model.
Data Visualization: Includes various visualizations such as data distribution, monthly expenses, feature importance, and category-wise expense distribution.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip for package installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-expense-prediction.git
cd daily-expense-prediction
Step 2: Install Required Packages
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Verify Streamlit Installation
Ensure Streamlit is installed correctly by checking its version:

bash
Copy code
streamlit --version
If the command above fails, you can run Streamlit using Python:

bash
Copy code
python -m streamlit --version
Getting Started
Prepare Your Dataset: Make sure your CSV file contains columns for Date, Time, Amount, Category, City, and Place.

Run the App:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Or, if streamlit isn’t recognized, use:

bash
Copy code
python -m streamlit run app.py
Access the App: Once started, the app will open in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Upload Dataset: In the sidebar, upload a CSV file containing daily expenses data.
Model Selection: Choose a model from the sidebar:
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest
Adjust Hyperparameters: Use the provided sliders to adjust model parameters such as degree of polynomial, alpha (regularization strength), or number of trees for the random forest.
View Predictions and Metrics: The main page will display model evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R² Score.
Explore Visualizations:
Expense Distribution: Histogram of expense amounts.
Monthly Predicted Expenses: Bar graph of monthly expenses.
Feature Importance: Displays the most influential features (available for Random Forest model).
Category-wise Expense Distribution: Pie chart for expense distribution by category.
